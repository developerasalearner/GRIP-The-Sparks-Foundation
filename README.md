# GRIP-The-Sparks-Foundation

During my internship at The Sparks Foundation, I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project that involved developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers. Our team decided to use the Navy's classification model to train our model, which resulted in a high level of accuracy in predicting the species of iris flower.

The iris flower classification problem is a popular dataset in machine learning, and it involves predicting the species of iris flower based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using supervised learning, we developed a model that could accurately classify the species of each flower.

Using the Navy's classification model, we trained our model on the iris flower dataset and achieved an accuracy of 96.67%. This means that our model was able to correctly predict the species of iris flower for 96.67% of the samples in the dataset. We were thrilled with these results and decided to evaluate our model's performance further.

We used a confusion matrix to evaluate our model's performance, and it revealed that our model had only one false prediction out of 45 test samples. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, and I am grateful to The Sparks Foundation for providing me with this opportunity.
